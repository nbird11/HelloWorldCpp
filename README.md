# Overview

As an up-and-coming software engineer, I'm trying to learn as much as possible in a variety of different languages.

This program outputs Hello World to the console.

The purpose is as a test run of trying to build and run C++ programs using VSCode as a text editor.

# Development Environment

I'm using Visual Studio Code as a text editor to write the code in C++ and the GNU g++ compiler to build the program executable.

The batch file is for easier compilation for the executable in Windows.
